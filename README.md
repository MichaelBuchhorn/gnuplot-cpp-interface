# Gnuplot-C++-Interface
### A simple pipe based interface for the popular visualisation program Gnuplot for C++ and Windows.

The project itself was created in Visual Studio 2017 (v141) but the code itself should also be easily compilable with non Microsoft compilers.

The Code is published under the MIT license.
